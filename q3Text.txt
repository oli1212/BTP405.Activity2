The cab arrived late. The inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was 
concerning, and it didn't appear that it had been cleaned in months. 
The green tree air-freshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted 
of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab. 
The correct decision, in this case, was to get the hell out of it and to call another 
cab, but she was late and didn't have a choice.
