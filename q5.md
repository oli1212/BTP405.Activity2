#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')

For the first approach, 
1. a function doubleL(n) takes in 'n' which is an integer
2. in that function, res = [] is initialized as an empty list
3. the for loop iterates through 'n'
4. it will then append the value result of 'i * 2' into res
5. the function will end returning the list res
6. the function doubleL(n) will recieve the input of n = 5
6. the for loop will then loop through the result return from the function which is res
7. in the for loop it will print ' : ' in between each result within res


#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')

For the second approach, 
1. '[n * 2 for n in range(5)]' is a list comprehension that creates another list with the list it will recieve from the for loop 'for n in range(5)'
2. each value in the new list is multipled by 2
3. 'for x in ..' for loop will iterate through the new list
4. in the for loop it will print ' : ' in between each result of 'x'

#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')

For the last approach, 
1. a function doubleG(n) takes in 'n' which is an integer
2. the for loop will iterate through the range of 'n'
3. yield is similar to a return statement but it returns a generator object whats different is that yield will pause after every execution 
and then it will wait for the next value to be requested like next()
4. 'for i in doubleG(5)' for loop will iterate through the values produced from 'doubleG(n)'
5. 'print(i, end=' : ')' this print statement will pritn the value of i, and then make sure that it finishes with ' : '
